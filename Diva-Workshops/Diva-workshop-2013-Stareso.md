(but be aware, this takes time and rental cars cannot use the last 3km
road to the Research Station).
So try to arrive at (via Paris, Marseille or Nice): [Calvi's
airport](http://www.calvi.aeroport.fr/AeroportCal/accueilAeroCal.php).

### Logistics

Transports from the Calvi airport to STARESO will be arranged according
to the arrival of the participants.
We cannot arrange car trips from Bastia to Calvi.
Please provide us with your flight schedules (arrival/departure times at
at/from Calvi as well as flight number).
If you plan to rent a car, let us know so that we can arrange trips for
other participants arriving at the same time.
Also let us know if you arrive earlier or leave later than the workshop
dates.

### Accommodation

The participants will be housed at the station.\
Bath towels and soap are provided in the rooms.\
Meals are taken on place. Let us know in advance if you have any food
preference.\
Power sockets are
[Type\~F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#CEE_7.2F5_.28French.29),
some of you may need adapters.

Registration
------------

Just send an email to Charles (ctroupin at ulg dot ac dot be) with your
intention to attend the workshop.
Later on we will ask you details concerning your flight schedules, in
order to organize transportation from the airport to the workshop venue.
Preference will be given to researchers so as to ensure a presence of
EMODnet and SeaDataNet partners.
Participants have to organize their travel and cover their travel
expenses.
Local accommodation (lodging and food) must be paid on place (340€ per
person for the four nights; cost of drinks are to be added based on
consumption).

Requirements
------------

Prior to the workshop, the participants are advised to perform a few
[installations](http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/index.php/Diva_installation)
of software and to prepare their own data files.

### Software

1.  Compilation and execution: [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) (if
    windows machine), a Fortran compiler (gfortran, ifort, …) and the
    netcdf library compiled with the same Fortran compiler that will be
    used for Diva.
2.  Visualization of results: gnuplot,
    [ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html),
    [ncbrowse](http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/) or any other
    plotting software that can read NetCDF format.
3.  Processing of results and advanced plotting:
    [python](http://www.python.org/),
    [octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or
    [matlab](http://www.mathworks.es/products/matlab/), and the NetCDF
    toolbox.\
    Check the page dedicated to the [plotting
    tools](http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/index.php/DIVA#Plotting_tools).

### Data files

1.  One or several data files in [ODV](http://odv.awi.de/)
    format (spreadsheet). The file may contain several variables
    if desired.
2.  A topography for you area of interest (you can extract one via [Diva
    on Web](http://gher-diva.phys.ulg.ac.be/web-vis-test/diva.html);
    just upload a data set and specify as output grid the grid you want
    for topography later)
