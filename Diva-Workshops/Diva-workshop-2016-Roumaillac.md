2.  Visualization of results: gnuplot, ncview, ncbrowse or any other plotting software that can read netCDF format.
3.  Processing of results and advanced plotting: matlab or octave, and a the NetCDF toolbox.

## Data files

1.  One or several data files in ODV format (spreadsheet). The file may contain several variables if desired.
2.  A topography for you area of interest.
