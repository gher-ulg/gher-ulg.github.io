Since 2006, we organize workshops for the DIVA users, principally members of the region groups responsible for the climatology production in [SeaDataNet](https://www.seadatanet.org/). During these workshops, several experts are present to help newcomers and the latest developments are presented for advanced users. Generally, a wish-list from users is established at the end of the workshop and most of the changes
are implemented during the following weeks or months.
