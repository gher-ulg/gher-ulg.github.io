# Diva Workshop -- 27-30 January 2020

This page provides the relevant information about the Diva user workshops organised in the frame of H2020 [SeaDataCloud](https://www.seadatanet.org/) project. [`Diva`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVA) and [`DIVAnd`](https://github.com/gher-ulg/divand.jl) are software tools implementing advanced techniques to generate gridded fields from in situ observations.

## General information

### Dates

<i class="fa fa-calendar-check-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> From Monday 27 January (1.30 PM) to Thursday 30 January (3 PM), 2020.

### Venue

üìç The 2020 edition will be hosted by the University of Bologna, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Viale Berti Pichat 6/2, 40127 Bologna, 2nd floor Classroom "Biomedica".


### Participants

Participants are expected to be partners of [SeaDataCloud](https://www.seadatanet.org/) or EMODnet [Chemistry](http://www.emodnet-chemistry.eu/), [Biology](http://www.emodnet-biology.eu/) or [Physics](https://www.emodnet-physics.eu/) lots. Other scientists or data managers may request an invitation by contacting the organisers.    

Priority will be given to those partners responsible for the Product preparation.

### Registration

üìß The registration is done by email: contact Evi (paraskevi.tsitsopoulou@cmcc.it) with Cc to Nadia (nadia.pinardi@unibo.it).        
**Deadline:** 15th of December, 2020.

### Accommodations

<i class="fa fa-bed" aria-hidden="true"></i> Bologna is a very busy town and we recommend you book at the Hotel before the end of 2019.

## Preliminary program

The workshop will be focused on `DIVAnd` (n-dimensional interpolation).

### Monday (1/2 day)

Checking of installations      
Theory: introduction to variational analysis     
Objective Analysis, Optimal Interpolation, and Variational Objective Analysis  

### Tuesday

Ocean reanalysis       
Data products consistency analysis       
New data products: how to better use `DIVAnd` (sliding decades)       
Ocean Monitoring Indicators, coastal high resolution maps             
Introduction to jupyter-notebook and basic Julia commands and major differences with `MATLAB` and `Python`
Data reading       
Preparation of topography      
How to define the background field       
Parameter optimization: horizontal and vertical correlation lengths, noise-to-signal ratio      

### Wednesday

Computation of error field          
Add advection constraint (afternoon)      

### Thursday

Wrap-up with future development ideas:
* From data integration to `DIVAnd`: how to harmonize the workflow
* Use of residuals to discard non-representative data in the climatology
* Consistency analysis of `DIVAnd` output with reference products

## Preparation

### Computers

Participants will have with them a laptop with:     
* 16 GB RAM memory and     
* sufficient free disk space (approx. 50 GB).
* Data files necessary for the preparation of a climatology.

More resources might be necessary depending on the resolution and size of the studied domain.

You may also need to check the list of [acronyms and definitions](../acronyms.md).

### Workshop material

The notebooks are availabe in the folder `notebooks` in the [zip file](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/archive/master.zip).
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/tree/master/notebooks#how-to-download-ipynb-files-from-github) to download and open the notebook files.

### Installation

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) language
* [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), the `Julia` kernel for Jupyter.
* [OceanDataView](https://odv.awi.de/), to pre-process the data files.

More details about the procedure: [installation](../installation.md).
