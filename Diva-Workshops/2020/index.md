üìç Meeting point: Department of Physics and Astronomy, Viale Berti Pichat 6/2, Bologna at 1:00 PM.
üïí Meeting start: 1.30 PM

Checking of installations
Theory: introduction to variational analysis
Objective Analysis, Optimal Interpolation, and Variational Objective Analysis

### Tuesday

Ocean reanalysis
Data products consistency analysis
New data products: how to better use `DIVAnd` (sliding decades)
Ocean Monitoring Indicators, coastal high resolution maps
Introduction to jupyter-notebook and basic `Julia` commands and major differences with `MATLAB` and `Python`
Data reading
Preparation of topography
How to define the background field
Parameter optimization: horizontal and vertical correlation lengths, noise-to-signal ratio

üçΩÔ∏è Social dinner

### Wednesday

Computation of error field
Add advection constraint (afternoon)

### Thursday

Wrap-up with future development ideas:
* From data integration to `DIVAnd`: how to harmonize the workflow
* Use of residuals to discard non-representative data in the climatology
* Consistency analysis of `DIVAnd` output with reference products

Afternoon (finish at 3PM), parallel session:
SeaDataCloud Product Meeting
üïí *Meeting closure:* 3 PM.

## Preparation

### Computers

Participants will have with them a laptop with:
* 16 GB RAM memory and
* sufficient free disk space (approx. 50 GB).
* Data files necessary for the preparation of a climatology.

More resources might be necessary depending on the resolution and size of the studied domain.

You may also need to check the list of [acronyms and definitions](../acronyms.md).

### Workshop material

The notebooks are availabe in the folder `notebooks` in the [zip file](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/archive/master.zip).
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/tree/master/notebooks#how-to-download-ipynb-files-from-github) to download and open the notebook files.

### Installation

Please install the following software beforehand:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) language
* [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), the `Julia` kernel for Jupyter.
* [OceanDataView](https://odv.awi.de/), to pre-process the data files.
* Follow the steps decribed here: [installation](../installation.md).
