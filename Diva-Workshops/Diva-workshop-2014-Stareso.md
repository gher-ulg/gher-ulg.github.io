(consider the travel times above and note that rental cars cannot be
used in the last 3 km of the road to the Research Station).
So try to arrive at [Calvi's
airport](http://www.calvi.aeroport.fr/AeroportCal/accueilAeroCal.php)

### Logistics

-   Transports from the Calvi airport to STARESO will be arranged
    according to the arrival of the participants.

Please provide us with your flight schedules (arrival/departure times at
at/from Calvi as well as flight number).

-   We cannot arrange car trips from Bastia to Calvi.

If you plan to rent a car, let us know so that we can arrange trips for
other participants arriving at the same time.

-   Let us know if you arrive earlier or leave later than the
    workshop dates.


### Accommodation

The participants will be housed at the station.\
Bath towels and soap are provided in the rooms.\
Meals are taken on place. Let us know in advance if you have any food
preference.

Power sockets are
[Type\~F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#CEE_7.2F5_.28French.29),
some of you may need adapters.

## Registration

Just send an email to Sylvain Watelet (**swatelet@doct.ulg.ac.be**) with
your intention to attend the workshop.

### Important

Since the number of participants who can attend the workshop is limited,
you are advised to wait for a confirmation before booking your flight
tickets.

Later on we will ask you details concerning your flight schedules, in
order to organize transportation from the airport to the workshop
venue.

Preference will be given to researchers so as to ensure a presence of
Emodnet and SeaDataNet partners.

### Costs

Participants have to organize their travel and cover their travel
expenses.       
Local accommodation (lodging and food) must be paid on place
(approximatively 340€ per person for the four nights; cost of drinks are

## Requirements
------------

Prior to the workshop, the participants are advised to perform a few
[installations](http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/index.php/Diva_installation)
of software and to prepare their own data files.

### Software

1.  Compilation and execution: [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) (if
    windows machine), a Fortran compiler (gfortran, ifort, …) and the
    netcdf library compiled with the same Fortran compiler that will be
    used for Diva.
2.  Visualization of results: gnuplot,
    [ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html),
    [ncbrowse](http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/) or any other
    plotting software that can read NetCDF format.
3.  Processing of results and advanced plotting:
    [python](http://www.python.org/),
    [octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or
    [matlab](http://www.mathworks.es/products/matlab/), and the NetCDF
    toolbox.\
    Check the page dedicated to the [plotting
    tools](http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/index.php/DIVA#Plotting_tools).

### Data files

1.  One or several data files in [ODV](http://odv.awi.de/)
    format (spreadsheet). The file may contain several variables
    if desired.
2.  A topography for you area of interest (you can extract one via [Diva
    on Web](http://gher-diva.phys.ulg.ac.be/web-vis-test/diva.html);
    just upload a data set and specify as output grid the grid you want
    for topography later)
